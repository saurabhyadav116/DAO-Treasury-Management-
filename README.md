## DAO Treasury Management

## Project Description
DAO Treasury Management is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that enables Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to efficiently manage their treasury funds. The system provides a transparent, secure, and democratic way for DAO members to propose, vote on, and execute financial decisions collectively.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a robust financial infrastructure for DAOs that empowers community governance while ensuring security and transparency. By streamlining treasury management, we aim to help DAOs focus more on their core missions rather than operational complexities.

## Key Features
- Proposal Creation: Members can create detailed funding proposals specifying amount, recipient, and purpose
- Democratic Voting: Token-weighted voting system for transparent decision-making
- Automatic Execution: Approved proposals are executed automatically when voting thresholds are met
- Treasury Overview: Real-time insights into treasury balances and transaction history
- Role-Based Access Control: Different permission levels for various stakeholders

## Future Scope

- Multi-chain treasury management capabilities
- Integration with popular DeFi protocols for yield optimization
- Advanced analytics dashboard for treasury performance
- Delegation mechanisms for voting rights
- Quadratic voting implementation for more equitable decision-making
- Timelock functionality for enhanced security
- Plugin architecture for customizable governance mechanisms
