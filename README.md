DAO Treasury Management
Project Description
DAO Treasury Management is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that enables Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to efficiently manage their treasury funds. The system provides a transparent, secure, and democratic way for DAO members to propose, vote on, and execute financial decisions collectively.
Project Vision
Our vision is to create a robust financial infrastructure for DAOs that empowers community governance while ensuring security and transparency. By streamlining treasury management, we aim to help DAOs focus more on their core missions rather than operational complexities.
